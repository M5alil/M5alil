\bio{
    Software developer with 6 years experience, Working in direct contact with engineering business
    house. I encountered many problems that we managed to solve by introducing commonly known
    solutions in the community, like DevOps CI/CD or unit testing in my early days, self-learning with
    little guidance. We also faced many problems when we had to work on legacy products that were
    developed 15 years or more when we succeeded in giving it more life into the companyâ€™s day-to-day
    use and needs.
